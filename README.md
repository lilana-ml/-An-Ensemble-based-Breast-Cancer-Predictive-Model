 A machine learning pipeline for breast cancer diagnosis using ensemble methods (Voting Classifier & XGBoost) with preprocessing, feature selection, and comprehensive evaluation.


## Key Modules

- `main.py` – Complete execution pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
- `model_builder.py` – Creates ensemble models and performs hyperparameter tuning.  
- `model_evaluator.py` – Evaluates and compares model performance using multiple metrics.  
- `visualization.py` – Generates plots and charts for results analysis.  
- `utils.py` – Utility functions for saving results, generating reports, and maintaining reproducibility


 ## Dependencies
 

Python 3.x

- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `imbalanced-learn`
